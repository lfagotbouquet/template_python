## Getting Help

The preferred way to get support is through **GitHub Issues**.

Before opening a new issue:

1. Check the existing issues (open and closed)
2. Read the README and documentation
3. Make sure you are using a supported Python version
4. Ensure all dependencies are up to date

If your question is answered in the documentation, the issue may be closed without response.

## Bug Reports

Use GitHub Issues to report bugs.

A good bug report includes:

* Clear description of the problem
* Steps to reproduce
* Expected vs actual behavior
* Python version and operating system
* Relevant logs or stack traces

Incomplete reports slow things down and may be closed.

## Feature Requests

Feature requests are welcome, but not all will be accepted.

When proposing a feature:

* Explain the problem you are trying to solve
* Describe why existing functionality is insufficient
* Consider the impact on complexity and maintenance

Features that significantly increase scope or maintenance burden may be declined.
