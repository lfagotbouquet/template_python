## Responsible Disclosure

We ask that you follow responsible disclosure practices:

* Avoid exploiting the vulnerability beyond proof-of-concept

We aim to acknowledge reports promptly and will work with you on disclosure timing where appropriate.

* Static analysis (e.g. Bandit)

These tools are helpful but **not a guarantee** of security.
